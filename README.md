# Introduction
For our reverse engineering course, we have decided to analyze and reverse engineer the "PDF Reader File Manager" application, which was known for being removed from the Play Store earlier this year. It was developed to steal data from Android users, as explained in this article [here](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/malware-adware/these-malicious-android-malware-apps-were-downloaded-150000-times-from-the-play-store-delete-them-right-now).
